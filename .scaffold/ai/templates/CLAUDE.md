## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include appropriate error handling
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Architecture Principles
- Keep components small and focused
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use dependency injection where beneficial
- Follow established patterns in the codebase

### Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create feature branches for new work
- Submit pull requests for code review
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for optimization validation
